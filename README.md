## Features

1. **Fundamental Analysis**
   - Analyze financial statements and key performance ratios of stocks.

2. **Technical Analysis**
   - Use technical indicators (e.g., RSI, moving averages) to identify trends and trading opportunities.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Extract sentiment from news, social media, or other sources to gauge market sentiment.

4. **Prediction**
   - Predict stock prices or trends using machine learning models.

5. **Backtesting**
   - Evaluate the performance of trading strategies on historical data.

6. **Simulation**
   - Simulate portfolio performance based on trading strategies or market conditions.

7. **Data Management**
   - Handle datasets for stock predictions, testing, and statistics efficiently.
